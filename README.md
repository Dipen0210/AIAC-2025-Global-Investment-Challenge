## ü§ñ AI-Inspired Thinking

While no automation was used, my **decision-making logic mirrored AI models**:

- **Signal Filtering**: Trades required technical + macro + theme alignment  
- **Pattern Recognition**: Breakouts, flags, failed breakdowns  
- **Thematic Clustering**: Summer = Travel = Visa + Hilton  
- **Event-Based Reaction**: Oil surges, CPI reports, earnings  
- **Probability-Weighted Actions**: Seasonality and price rarity shaped conviction
